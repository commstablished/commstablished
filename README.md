- 👋 Hi, I’m @commstablished
- 👀 I’m interested in anything to do with technologies and can't wait to fall deeper into the functions/operations of Linux.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 12 certifications regarding CyberSecurity and have found that most of my tools or setups will revolve around Linux and so far I've been loving everything. Yes, there has been some frustrating moments since I've changed most of my PC/Laptop environemnt to Linux based OS's but its pretty rewarding once I figure out each new tool.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever or with whoever. I'm a telecomms technician by profession and feel have mastered all connections physically and now its time to ramp it up and learn the digital side for a full SME experience. If your project no matter how big or complex, needs some beefy network cabling infrastructure feel free to reach out. (Including fibre splicing)
- 📫 How to reach me - I'm in Australia and this is my first time using GitHub - if there's a chat function on here, feel free to reach out.
